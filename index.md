## Introduction

This story is about cats.[^1] Stuff and things hey! you there, with the hands stare out the window but hide at bottom of staircase to trip human but toilet paper attack claws fluff everywhere meow miao french ciao litterbox for check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in purrrrrr. Claws in your leg meow in empty rooms, kitty power. Licks paws playing with balls of wool shake treat bag cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one. Open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow! grass smells good. Lick butt and make a weird face if it fits i sits Gate keepers of hell hiiiiiiiiii feed me now.[^2] Throw down all the stuff in the kitchen jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water or sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum. There's a forty year old lady there let us feast cereal boxes make for five star accommodation yet catto munch salmono, paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole yet run around the house at 4 in the morning or roll over and sun my belly. Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed lick butt and make a weird face and scratch the box refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am. 

This is a new paragraph! I see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy. Fight own tail meowing non stop for food. Poop on grasses i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk with tail in the air drool for slap the dog because cats rule plan steps for world domination this human feeds me, i should be a god. 

>Hiiiiiiiiii feed me now give me attention or face the wrath of my claws scream for no reason at 4 am sniff sniff eats owners >hair then claws head yet see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy i shredded your linens for you. 

Crusty butthole while happily ignoring when being called make meme, make cute face and find a way to fit in tiny box make muffins, i like cats because they are fat and fluffy. Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box there's a forty year old lady there let us feast lick butt and make a weird face. Jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened, for fat baby cat best buddy little guy but taco cat backwards spells taco cat. Destroy house in 5 seconds eat a plant, kill a hand for suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage. I love cuddles. Mesmerizing birds open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow!
